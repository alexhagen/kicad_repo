# currently pseudocode for how to publish a kicad circuit and associated files
# to a repo

# first, check for the three folders, 'code', 'sim', 'circuit'

# run binary to blender draw the circuit
# run binary to 2d draw the circuit
# find text file for tags
# combine these things using pandoc? into an html file

# checkout branch gh-pages
# place html file generated into '<repo-gh-pages>/kicad_repo/index.html'
# commit with either a given message or default
# push to repo
# now somehow send to the mothership!
